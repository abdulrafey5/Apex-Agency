You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742

2025-10-09 11:37:00,543 - INFO - Received message for OpenAI: how you can guide agents beneath you what python logic should i implement as i am doing project of making agents and dept at runtime
2025-10-09 11:37:10,424 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-10-09 11:37:10,425 - INFO - OpenAI reply: As a CEA, I'd suggest the following Python logic:

1. Define your Agent and Department classes with necessary attributes and methods.
2. For creating agents at runtime, you could use a factory pattern. The factory function can take parameters to decide which type of agent to create.
3. Each agent can have a method to perform their specific task. You can also have a higher-level function to manage the agents and their tasks.
4. Department class can maintain a list of its agents. Add methods to add or remove agents dynamically.
5. You can create agents and assign them to departments at runtime based on your project requirements.

Here's a rough idea of how the classes could look:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, type):
        self.name = name
        self.type = type
    def perform_task(self):
        pass

class Department:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []
    def add_agent(self, agent):
        self.agents.append(agent)
    def remove_agent(self, agent):
        self.agents.remove(agent)
    def manage_agents(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.perform_task()
```
Remember to replace the pass statement with your own logic for the agent's task.

When you need to create agents or departments at runtime, you can simply create new instances of these classes.

2025-10-09 11:38:18,146 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-10-09 11:38:18,150 - INFO - OpenAI reply: No, creating agents doesn't necessarily require EBS storage or sample JSON in each agent. Agents can be created and operated from a variety of sources and storage solutions, depending on the specific needs of the application. JSON files or other data formats can be used to configure and train agents, but this is not a strict requirement. The details would vary based on the specific agent creation platform or framework you're using.
