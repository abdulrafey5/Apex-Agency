    Umbrella Waterfall is a stunning natural wonder located in the village of Sajjikot, in the Tehsil of Pind Dadan Khan,
    Jhelum District, Punjab Province, Pakistan. Nestled within the scenic Salt Range mountains, it''s a hidden gem for nature
    lovers, hikers, and adventure seekers. The waterfall gets its unique name from the way the water cascades over a broad,
    overhanging rock formation, resembling the shape of an open umbrella—especially during the monsoon season when the flow
    is at its peak.


    #### Key Features and Description

    - **Height and Flow**: The waterfall isn''t extremely tall (around 20-30 feet), but its charm lies in the wide, veil-like
    curtain of water that spreads out like an umbrella. The surrounding area features rugged cliffs, lush greenery, and small
    pools at the base where you can dip your feet or even swim in calmer months.

    - **Natural Surroundings**: Sajjikot itself is a picturesque rural village with terraced fields, ancient rock formations,
    and proximity to other attractions like the Khewra Salt Mine (one of the world''s largest salt mines) and the nearby Choa
    Saidan Shah shrine. The Salt Range''s geology, with its fossil-rich hills and diverse flora, adds to the allure.

    - **Best Time to Visit**: The ideal season is from July to September during the monsoon rains, when the waterfall is in
    full force and the landscape turns vibrant green. In winter (November to February), it''s more of a trickle but offers
    a peaceful, misty vibe. Avoid summer (May-June) due to extreme heat.


    #### How to Get There

    - **From Lahore**: Drive about 200-250 km northwest via the M-2 Motorway (Lahore-Islamabad). Exit at Kallar Kahar or Pind
    Dadan Khan, then head towards Jhelum. The total journey takes 3-4 hours by car.

    - **From Islamabad/Rawalpindi**: It''s roughly 150 km south, a 2-3 hour drive via GT Road (Grand Trunk Road) towards Jhelum.

    - **Local Access**: From Jhelum city, Sajjikot is about 20-25 km away. You can take a local bus or taxi to Pind Dadan
    Khan, then a jeep or rickshaw to the village. The last stretch involves a short hike (15-30 minutes) on a dirt path—wear
    sturdy shoes'
